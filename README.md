## Learn Everything Bot - AI Powered App
Learn Everything Bot is an Android application built for focused, rapid learning. Type a subject and the app instantly generates a clickable topic structure. Tap any topic to get an AI-generated summary and three persisted questions (easy, medium, hard). As you explore more topics, more questions are stored. When you‚Äôre ready, take a quiz to test your knowledge. The app features a clean interface, light/dark themes, and modern Android architecture powered by the OpenAI API.
